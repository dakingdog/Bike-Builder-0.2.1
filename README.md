This is a personal fork of our bike-builder project from CS326.
Overall goals: fix dropdown population in part selection
Part filtering based on bike type (unsure if this actually works)
Possible conversion to Ruby on Rails (experimental)
Fix a few small bugs here'n there, such as js console errors
